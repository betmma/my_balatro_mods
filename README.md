A collection of mods made by me for Balatro.
# 5 legendary challenges: Adds 5 challenges, each featuring a legendary joker.
- Destroyer: With eternal caino, pareidolia and sixth sense, you need to acquire and destroy 6s to get multi.
- Gotta Go Fast: Begin with triboulet, but the required score scales extremely fast.
- Bankrupt: Begin with $100 and yorick, but each discard costs $10, so eventually you'll go bankrupt.
- Anti-Medusa: The deck is full of stones, and the only way to unpetrify cards is the empress generated by perkeo.
- Overpowered Boss: All boss blinds halve your base chips and multi, and the only source of money is matador. There is a soul card with chicot in it, so when to use?

# Betmma Jokers: Adds 7 jokers.
- JJookkeerr: Jokers with the word "Joker" in their names each gives X1.5 Mult.
- Ascension: Increase the tier of played joker hand by 1. e.g. High Card counts as One Pair. 
- Hasty Joker: Earn $8 if round ends after first hand.
- ERRORR: Discarded cards have 1 in 3 chance to become random rank.
- Piggy Bank: Put half of earned dollars into it and gain 1 Mult for each dollar.

- Jimbow: This Joker gains +15 Chips when {context}. Context changes when achieved.

# Betmma Vouchers: Adds 50 Vouchers and 24 fusion Vouchers.
Vouchers have rarities. Rarity affects the chance a voucher is added into the random pool. Only vouchers added into the pool can be chosen and appear. For example, if you have redeemed all vouchers but one uncommon, rare or legendary voucher, it still can not appear. Specifically, the chances for uncommon, rare and legendary vouchers to be in the pool are 1/2, 1/4 and 1/20. Vanilla vouchers and vouchers from other mods are considered common.

This structure code is based on [Coupon Book mod](https://github.com/nicholassam6425/balatro-mods/blob/main/balamod/mods/p_coupon_book.lua) which is for Balamod. I ported it into steamodded and added lots of content.

# Note that [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) is required to load the mods.
The mods are written and tested on Steamodded 1.0.0. There was code for 0.9.8 compatibility but since most people are shifting to SMOD 1.0.0 and SMOD 1.0.0 supports 0.9.8 mods now, I won't check 0.9.8 compatibility very frequently and can't promise its compatibility.
